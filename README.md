# Stable Diffusion Tech Talk

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring various approaches to generating consistent images of people using DALL-E 2 API, stable diffusion, and LORA stable diffusion. This README provides an overview of each project and directs you to their respective Git repositories for more detailed information.

## Projects
1. **DALL-E 2 API**: This project explores the capabilities of the DALL-E 2 API for generating images of people based on my previous project.
   - [Git Repository:](https://github.com/pr0fi7/dalle2app)

2. **Stable Diffusion**: Utilizing stable diffusion techniques for denoising images and enhancing consistency in people generation.
   - [Git Repository:](https://github.com/pr0fi7/image_inpainter)

     - [Article 2](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/)
     - [Inspiring Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFztPP9qPRc)

3. **LORA Stable Diffusion**: Investigating LORA stable diffusion methods for further improving image consistency.
You can find `AutoTrain_Dreambooth.ipynb` file with which you can finetune stablediffusion model.

## Presentation
In this repository, you'll also find a `Presentation.pdf` file containing a detailed presentation with supporting images. This presentation delves into the topic of stable diffusion and its applications in image generation.


Feel free to explore each project and delve deeper into the fascinating world of image generation and stable diffusion techniques!
